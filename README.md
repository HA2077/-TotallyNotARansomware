LEGAL DISCLAIMER:

This software is created SOLELY for cybersecurity education and awareness
Using this code for malicious purposes is ILLEGAL and may result in severe legal consequences
Deploying ransomware is a SERIOUS CRIME in most jurisdictions worldwide
The author assumes NO RESPONSIBILITY for any misuse of this code
This tool is intended to help understand ransomware mechanics for DEFENSIVE PURPOSES ONLY

üéì Educational Objectives
This project demonstrates:

Cryptographic concepts in cybersecurity

File system operations and security implications

Defensive programming techniques

Cybersecurity awareness and prevention strategies

---

üìã How It Works
Architecture Overview

The simulation consists of two main components:
1. Encryption Module (notransomware.py)

Simulates file encryption using cryptographic libraries

Demonstrates how ransomware targets specific file types

Shows encryption key generation and management

Educational implementation of file system traversal

2. Decryption Module (Decrypt.py)

Demonstrates the decryption process

Shows proper key management for recovery

Educational example of cryptographic operations

Illustrates file restoration procedures

üîß Technical Implementation
Key Features:

Limited Scope: Only affects files in the directory where it runs (not system-wide)
Symmetric Encryption: Uses industry-standard encryption algorithms
File Discovery: Targets specific file types within the execution directory
Key Management: Demonstrates secure key generation and storage

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitation:
This simulation ONLY affects files in the same directory as the executable - it does NOT spread across your system or network, making it safer for educational use.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Research & Defense
What This Teaches About Ransomware Defense:

File Backup Strategies: Understanding why regular, isolated backups are critical

Network Segmentation: How proper network design limits ransomware spread

Endpoint Detection: Recognizing suspicious file system activities

Incident Response: Procedures for handling ransomware incidents

User Education: Training users to recognize and avoid ransomware vectors

Defensive Measures Demonstrated:

File system monitoring techniques

Encryption detection methods

Recovery procedures and best practices

Security awareness indicators
